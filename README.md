## 🔐 Declaration of Originality  
This document represents the original time-structural analysis and trading system design called **Morpheus Chrono™**.  
Its logic, hierarchy of time zones, and internal/external imbalance treatment were developed independently, without reference to any existing institutional, educational, or algorithmic systems.

---

## 🧩 System Core

Morpheus Chrono is based on **stacked, unfilled imbalances** that create zones of probabilistic entry opportunities.  
It uses a defined **time-rotation logic**, ignoring common indicators like RSI, OB/OS or moving average crossovers.

---

## ⏱ Time-Based Entries (Chrono Points)
Examples of entry timestamps:  
**02:02, 03:03, 08:08, 09:09**, etc.  
These points are not random – they are calculated and used within a structure of multi-timeframe imbalance logic.

---

## 🔍 Imbalance Stack Structure
The strategy observes imbalances across the following hierarchy:  
**3H > 30min > 3min > 1min**  
An entry is activated only if **active (unfilled) imbalance zones** are detected across timeframes.

---

## ⚙ Wick Gap Logic (within Morpheus Chrono)
**Definition:** A wick that is not overlapped by the body or wick of the neighboring candle (left or right) is considered a micro/macro imbalance.

**Rule:** If even 1% of a wick remains unfilled, that zone is still considered **active**.

**Application:** Most effective when stacked with other imbalances and combined with chrono entries.

## 🎯 Algorithmic Structure Summary

- Focus: Time-based rotation + Imbalance logic  
- Mechanism: Algorithmic activation with no need for confirmation from classic indicators  
- Entry: Clean trigger based on candle time, not signal overlays  
- Uniqueness: Temporal-structural patterning never before published
